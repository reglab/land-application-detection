###### META-INFO FOR THIS RUN ######
# An optional descriptive name for this run, to easily fetch relevant rows from the database
# There is also a unique run_id and timestamp that is auto-generated and stored in the pipeline_runs DB table, which can be used
# to look up specific runs. That table also has the status of the run, which config params were used, and more.
run_nickname: ""

# Note: the logging level, along with the path to this config file + secrets file, are fed in as 
# command-line arguments to the main run_pipeline.py script.

###### PATHS TO EXISTING DATA FILES #######

# Path to CSV file of locations to pull imagery for, with lat and long columns
locations_filename: "/home/elpcphatami/centroids_list_first10.csv"
#some column info for this file
lat_name: Latitude
lon_name: Longitude

# Path to shapefiles of cities/towns, and of WDNR fields

###### READING/WRITING FILES ######

gcs_bucket: elpccafo_bucket # bucket to save raw planet downloaded imagery to
gcs_save_path: test_planet_ims/ # path within bucket (folder path) for planet imagery
root: /home/elpcphatami/preprocessed_images/ # root folder in local filesystem to read/write pre-processed Planet imagery (i.e., tiled images)
gc_save: false # Whether to save pre-processed image tiles to GCS as well
local_save: true # If true, then it won't delete locally saved files after pre-processing

replace_tiled_local: skip # choose one of ['ask', 'all', or 'skip'] 
# This refers to code in the image pre-processing script (tile and filter tiffs). 
# If a previously tiled image exists locally, for the same location-date, then:
# 'ask' will ask for user input while the code is running, to confirm whether to overwrite or skip for each one
# 'all' will assume that everything must be done from scratch, and the previous tiled files must be wiped
# 'skip' will just skip doing the processing if it sees something exists already in the local filesystem.
replace_tiled_cloud: skip # choose one of ['ask', 'all', 'skip']
# Behaves similarly as above, except this is for a check if the tiled image exists in the GCS cloud bucket. If it finds a tiled image in the cloud, then:
# 'ask' will ask for user input while the code is running for each image, to confirm whether to pull it from the cloud or do the preprocessing from scratch
# 'all' will do all of the pre-processing from scratch
# 'skip' will always pull the tile from the cloud 

db_schema: launch_test_elpc # which schema to use in the database (practically used for switching between launch_test_elpc schema and live deployment one)

###### PLANET IMAGERY PARAMETERS ######
item_type: PSScene
asset_type: ortho_visual
aoi_height: 6000 #in meters (aoi = area of interest, with the location lat-long as the midpoint)
aoi_width: 6000 #in meters (aoi = area of interest, with the location lat-long as the midpoint)
cloud_percent: 0.2 #images must be less than this proportion cloudy (0.2 means 20% of image is covered)

###### IMAGE PROCESSING PARAMETERS #####
black_thresh: 0.8 # remove images with more than this % of black pixels
tilesize: 670 # splits larger tiffs from planet into smaller tiffs of this size
min_tilesize: 300 #minimum size on both axes for split tifs, set to 0 for no min size

weights: /home/elpcphatami/new_weights.pt
class_config: /home/elpcphatami/land-application-detection/elpc_pipeline/configs/class_info.yaml
conf_thresh: 0.2 # only detections >= this score are stored + sent to the database 
# yolo_run_name: # Note: yolo experiment name is now just set automatically as 'exp{run_id}' to make it easier to find
max_detections: 1000 # maximum detections per image
iou_thresh: 0.45 # non-max-suppression IOU Threshold. Basically if two detections overlap by more than this %, de-duplicate and only keep the detection with the higher score
img_size: 640 # square image inference size (height and width)
